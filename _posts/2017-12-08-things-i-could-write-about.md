There is an unlimited amount of subjects to choose from when starting this, and my brain feels a little like that scene in Westworld where Maeve is looking at her own thoughts and freezes for a moment.


I'm just going to list out the subjects here, one by one.

- personal life
  - I just moved to Washington
    - I drove 2600 miles to get here in 3 days and the view was amazing
    - I bought an RV and am in the process of setting it up.
- professional life
  - I work with ruby on rails on a daily basis
  - We have an interesting approach to agile, scrum and kanban
- hobbies
  - finance. I want to be financially stable.
  - travel. There are more places that I want to go than I have been
  - this blog (or whatever it is. public writing space.)
    - there are so many things I could add.
      - comments
      - images
      - videos
      - games
      - datasets
    - what is the theme?

Now that I have a list, I can just pick stuff from it.  each line item is a post, or a series of posts.  Feels very sprint-like as a matter of fact.
