This is my second read-through of this book.  I'm not usually big on rereading, but this one offered a wealth of day to day strategies for dealing with the annoyances of being busy.  

I found this book to be an accessible read that talks about the processing that occurs in everyday decisions we make.  Each chapter in this book can more or less stand alone, although there are some references to previous chapeters as you go.  

Instead of writing an end to end narrative review of this book, I decided to list the chapters in **bold** With one line in *italic* to describe my takeaway from it.  Punchiness aside, I did get alot from every chapter of this book.

- **Algorithms To Live By** : *You're Smarter Than You Think You Are*
  1. **Optimal stopping** : *The Art Of Finding A Parking Spot.*
  1. **Explore/Exploit** : *How To Find The Best Slot Machine.*
  1. **Sorting** : *How To Become A Professional Closet Organizer.*
  1. **Caching** : *What Is On _Your_ Desk?*
  1. **Scheduling** : *When You Have So Much To Do That You Decide To Do Nothing.*
  1. **Bayes' Rule** : *Your Predictions Of The Future Are Probably As Good As Anyone Elses.*
  1. **Overfitting** : *You Can Make Anything Look Like Anything With A Little Creativity.*
  1. **Relaxation** : *Rules Are For Chumps.*
  1. **Randomness** : *Embrace The Chaos.*
  1. **Networking** : *Communication Is Hard.*
  1. **Game Theory** : *How Much Impact Do Others Actually Have On Our Own Lives?*
  1. **Conclusion** : *We All Do Some Pretty Complicated Stuff in Our Heads Without Even Trying.*

Let me know if you read it, I would enjoy talking about this book!
